NutMouse CMS
============

This will be a content management system based on PHP and SQL. The aim is to make it as small and overviewable as possible, while including as many options as possible. To do so, it will consist of diferent modules, such as:

- content pages
- news
- pics and galeries
- calender and events
- contact management

The core should include:

- a simple MVC engine
- a simple caching system
- a simple template system and parser
- a simple locale system for multilanguage sites and templates
